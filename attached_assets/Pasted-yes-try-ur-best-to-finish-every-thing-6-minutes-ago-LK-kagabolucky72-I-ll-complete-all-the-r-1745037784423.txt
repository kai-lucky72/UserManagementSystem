I'll complete all the remaining functionality according to the system design document. Let's check what else is needed and implement everything systematically.

First, let's create a TeamLeader API endpoints as mentioned in the system design:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now, let's implement the team leader pages to allow them to view their team members and manage reporting. First, let's create the TeamLeader layout:

Let's create the directory first:


Executed mkdir -p client/src/components/team-leader
Now, let's create the TeamLeader layout:


Created client/src/components/team-leader/layout.tsx
Now, let's create the team leader dashboard page:


Executed mkdir -p client/src/pages/team-leader
Let's create the team leader dashboard page:


Created client/src/pages/team-leader/dashboard-page.tsx
Let's create the team members page for team leaders:


Created client/src/pages/team-leader/members-page.tsx
Now, let's create the reports page for team leaders:


Created client/src/pages/team-leader/reports-page.tsx
Now, let's create the attendance page for team leaders:


Created client/src/pages/team-leader/attendance-page.tsx
Finally, let's update the App.tsx to include the Team Leader routes:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
I'm analyzing your project progress so far.

Looking at recent work completed:
✓ Added member removal functionality for agent groups
✓ Implemented API endpoint for removing agents from groups
✓ Added TeamLeader specific API routes
✓ Created foundation for TeamLeader interface components
→ Working on TeamLeader dashboard pages and routing

I'm making good progress implementing the remaining features for the Agent Management System. Currently focusing on completing the Team Leader functionality with proper dashboard pages and navigation.
